# Cycle-Time-Estimation-and-Improvement-of-Production-Line

This case study focused on reducing cycle time in a semiconductor wafer production facility with three distinct production flows: cleaning, etching, and lithography. An analysis of process times, setup durations, tool failures, and repair intervals identified significant bottlenecks in the lithography process that hindered overall efficiency. To address these challenges, three strategies were proposed: adding an extra lithography machine to improve cycle time, developing a multi-purpose tool to streamline processing steps, and hiring skilled mechanics to reduce repair times. The cost-benefit analysis revealed that developing the new multi-purpose tool emerged as the most effective and efficient solution. This strategy is expected to enhance production speed, reduce manufacturing time, and improve the facility's competitive position in the industry while ensuring that it can meet increasing market demands effectively.
